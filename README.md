# BGR-Palette-with-Trackbars
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. In this article, Let’s create a window which will contain RGB color palette with track bars. By moving the trackbars the value of RGB Colors will change b/w 0 to 255. So using the same, we can find the color with its RGB values.
Approach: 
Create a black window with three color channels with resolution 512 x 512. Then create three ‘B’ ‘G’ ‘R’ trackbars using predefined functions of OpenCV library. Set the values of channels from 0 to 255. Merging the black window with these color trackbars.
Libraries needed:
